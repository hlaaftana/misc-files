# misc-files
These are files that were on my laptop that I decided to put on the internet. This is not a good candidate for a portfolio though because a lot of this is old junk code. Also the way I used to name things is not easy for the eye (commit names are REALLY BAD).

## Outline, by order of least significant to most

### Discord

Junk Julia and Nim wrappers I wrote in 2015/2016. There is an actual Julia wrapper now somewhere and I made multiple Nim bots over time without a library, those are in my profile.

My old Discord content that got their own repositories, might forget to update this with time so excuse me:

* [DiscordG](https://github.com/metagodcore/DiscordG): Discord library for Groovy
* [LOLHr](https://github.com/metagodcore/LOLHr): Discord client in JavaFX (don't sue me)
* [toilet/Karma Fields/|><|](https://github.com/metagodcore/toilet): Discord bot using DiscordG
* [pkpsgpsg](https://github.com/metagodcore/pkpsgpsg): Discord bot with compile time command registering with macros/templates in Nim. Superseded by [locacaca](https://github.com/metagodcore/locacaca)

### Euler 451

My attempt at solving Project Euler problem 451, fairly recent by the time I put up this repository. My computer wasn't fast enough for it and I couldn't think of something that would compute faster so I just dropped it. "Programmer challenges" are really stupid to me now.

### nimvegas

Was going to be a wrapper for the Sony Vegas JavaScript scripting API for Nim's JavaScript backend, but the reference was too long to implement everything by hand, so I had the idea of scraping the HTML reference I found for it. Never did anything with it.

### Languages

Programming languages I tried to make then moved on.

* Lip: Very crappy language overall but the syntax was super weird and complicated.
* JVM: Groovy DSL for generating JVM bytecode. Tried to familliarize myself with the JVM, but got super bored making it and dropped it.
* Soda: I started programming with the JVM so when I moved to a new language and everything I made was in the old language, I tried to make a new language that would feel as good as the new language but run on the runtime of the old one. Was doing too much at once, dropped it.
* Ty: I wrote a type system for this in Java then accidentally deleted it and lost all my progress. I did write a Nim tokenizer, which I fixed up and am still fixing up and using to this day for other things.
* TestingSpeed: Was testing performance between different Kismet versions. See this directory for history

Most other files are concepts.

### Games

* Pink: Ignore please, JavaFX base project code
* 2D: Tile based Swing game implementation in Java. An effort to make [Wobby](https://github.com/metagodcore/Wobby) simpler.
* kaizo: A friend and I were planning to make this game together but we lost interest. Nim and SDL, was written after [BrokenAce's Time Machine](https://github.com/metagodcore/BAsTimeMachine)

Other old projects: [technocracy](https://github.com/metagodcore/technocracy), [Chemical Energistics](https://github.com/metagodcore/Chemical-Energistics)
